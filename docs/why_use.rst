Why use django-nested-admin?
============================

First of all: because it's the only implementation (currently known to us) that is actively developed/maintained, and therefor tested with Django 2.x versions.

Besides that, some other points:

Above, you will find a feature comparison of all other implementations of nested inlines in the django admin of which I am aware. `django-nested-inline`_, `django-nested-inlines`_, and `dj-nested-inlines`_ are all variations upon `a patch <https://code.djangoproject.com/attachment/ticket/9025/nested_inlines_finished.diff>`_ posted to Django `ticket #9025 <https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/9025>`_. `django-nested-inlines`_ has had no commits since 2013 and appears to be abandoned, with `dj-nested-inlines`_ being a better maintained fork. It, along with `django-nested-inline`_, are maintained insofar as the maintainers merge in pull requests and update PyPI, but they do not appear to be working on improving these implementations themselves. `django-super-inlines`_ is a fresher take on the problem, and looks to be more promising.

The largest functional difference between `django-nested-admin`_ and these other projects is its support for drag-and-drop sorting functionality within and between inlines, similar to Grappelli’s sortable inline feature (though it does not require Grappelli). It also has fairly extensive test coverage. And lastly `django-nested-admin`_ is and will remain an integral part of the CMS that powers `TheAtlantic.com`_ (and `CityLab.com`_) where it is used by editors to curate the homepages, email newsletters, and landing pages for special projects and site sections (the way we used `django-nested-admin`_ to power the curation of `TheAtlantic.com`_’s homepage was the subject of `a talk we gave at the 2015 Djangocon <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWLQTCUpyWw>`_).
